How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related, making web applications more reliable. Competent degradation means designing applications that will seamlessly handle lower levels of technology, starting with full functionality and then scaling back as needed without causing problems for the user. Service workers help with this by allowing web applications to continue running even when there is no Internet connection. They do this by storing important files and data on the user's device. This way, even if someone has a slow or no internet connection, they will still be able to use the app's key features, ensuring a seamless experience no matter the network situation. This combination helps ensure that everyone can access the app's core features, regardless of internet quality.
